# Conferences You Ought To Know About

There are thousands of conferences out there, I personally never attended one
mostly because I don't like 3 days across oceans travel and also because I like
to relate travelling with beaches, drinks and no computer thoughts.

But other than developer conferences, there are some exellent conferences that
relate to Systems Engineering, Distributed Systems and Databases that you ought
to know about.

**Conference List** :

- VLDB (Very Large DataBases): as the name suggests this is a database con where
[Gorilla] was introduced and many other systems.

- SIGMOD: less academic than VLDB, lots of industrial researchers publish here.

- HOTOS: how can I miss the conference where McSheery showed once again that 
if it fits in RAM then you don't need a distributed compute architecture.

- SIGOPS: every "Big Name" that gets thrown around (Lamport, Birell, Rosenblum)
have published and won Hall of Fame awards here.
