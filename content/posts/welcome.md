This isn't my first blog, but this is the first blog I plan to keep for a while.
I've always found that blogging is a good habit, it helps structure what you learn
keeps you less distracted and also helps share knowledge with others.

I plan to write about things I am currently learning about right now (databases).
Things I find useful at work (reliability) and even hobby projects (compilers).

From time to time I'll write a more personal note on things I like doing that
don't involve computers such as [surf]() or [books]().

This blog is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Cactus
Themes](https://github.com/monkeyWzr/hugo-theme-cactus) with few changes.
